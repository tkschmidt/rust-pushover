rust-pushover
=============

A rust crate for sending messages via the [Pushover.net](https://pushover.net/) service. It currently uses the excellent [rust-http](https://github.com/chris-morgan/rust-http) but will be converted to [teepee](https://github.com/teepee/teepee) when that reaches a usable state.

Building
----------
Just use ```cargo build``` to build. There is also a test suit available with ```cargo test```
